Main repository for the reinforcement-learning based path-planning Summer Internship Project supervised by Dr. Zhongguo Li at the University of Manchester.

Present aims of the project seeks to convert MATLAB example code into Python to leverage usage of PyTorch.

The code has been fully translated through to Python, but still requires debugging to remove errors and check correct operation.

Attached below are screenshots of replicated operation thusfar:


The following steps of the project are to integrate other concentration curves than the Gaussian Plume (generating a point-source radioactive emitter instead), as well as general improvements to path-length and other parameters of the algorithm.
